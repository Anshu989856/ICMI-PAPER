## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This study investigates the variations in healthcare test prices across Indian cities using an extended Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method enhanced with machine learning techniques.

We introduce a novel dataset â€” **HEALTH-PRICE** â€” combining city-level demographics, economics, and healthcare infrastructure data. Using traditional regression and neural models, we decompose the observed price disparities into **explained** (e.g., city population, per capita income, number of labs) and **unexplained** (e.g., market inefficiencies, provider behavior) components.

Our analysis reveals:
- Significant structural inefficiencies in diagnostic pricing
- Potential policy pathways to improve affordability
- Actionable insights for making diagnostic services more equitable

## ðŸ§  Key Contributions

- Developed an extended multi-group Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition framework.
- Integrated machine learning (MLP neural networks + SHAP) for non-linear counterfactual modeling.
- Built and released the **HEALTH-PRICE** dataset with over 126,000 entries across 101 Indian cities.
- Proposed targeted policy strategies based on empirical decomposition.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The **HEALTH-PRICE** dataset includes:
- 101 Indian cities
- 1393 diagnostic test types
- 163 diseases
- City-level predictors: population, income, lab density, city type, and zone
- Test prices collected using Selenium + BeautifulSoup scraping from Lal PathLabs

*Note: The dataset and scraping scripts are not included here but are referenced in the paper and hosted externally.*

## ðŸ§® Methodology

We employ both:
- **OLS-based Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition**
- **Neural Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition** using feedforward neural networks and SHAP interpretability

The study quantifies:
- **Explained component**: Impact of observable variables
- **Unexplained component**: Structural and unobservable effects

---

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels
- Selenium & BeautifulSoup (for scraping)
- PyTorch (for neural decomposition)
- SHAP (Shapley values for NN interpretability)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
